# Cozy Farm Game - Rosewood Farm

## A Basic Farming Role-Playing Game (RPG)
This project is a mini farming simulator game where you the player run a humble farm with crops and farm animals. As the farmer:

- Plant seasonal crops, water and wait for them to grow, then eat or sell for profits!
- Purchase and care for farm animals, such as cows, goats, and sheep! You can collect items like milk or wool and sell for profit!
- Explore the map and visit the Market!

This game is inspired by the cozy game genre and my personal love for nostalgic pixel top down games.
